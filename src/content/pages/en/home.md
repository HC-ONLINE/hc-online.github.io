# Hi, I'm Andrés Henríquez

I am a developer and researcher focused on web application security and architecture. I am passionate about building practical, elegant tools for auditing, orchestration, and maintainable software design.

## ***What I do***

I focus on building solutions that:

- Prioritize security by design and least privilege.
- Facilitate observability, traceability, and access control.
- Are sustainable and reusable, featuring clear logic and justified dependencies.
- Integrate DevOps practices with automation and reproducible deployments.

## ***Tecnical focus***

I work with a stack oriented toward secure backend development, automation, and modern frontend. I combine languages and tools that optimize both performance and long-term maintenance.

### ***Languages ​​and frameworks***

- ***Python***: Scripting, responsible scraping, automation and analysis tools.

- ***Java + Spring Boot***: REST APIs, secure authentication/authorization, security models (JWT vs Sessions)

### ***Frontend and UI***

***Astro + Tailwind***: CSS-first frontend architecture focused on scalability and visual consistency.

### ***DevOps and deployment***

***Docker***: Containerization and consistent environments.

***GitHub Actions***: Test automation and CI/CD pipelines.

### ***Version Control and Collaboration***

***Git*** and ***GitHUb***: Collaborative workflows (Issues, Pull Requests) to ensure code quality and traceability.
